# Plasma Wallpaper

This project is a webpage that displays plasmas dynamically, like a wallpaper. It uses HTML5 canvas element and JavaScript to generate and animate the plasma effect.

## Files

- `index.html`: This file is the main HTML file for the webpage. It contains the structure of the webpage and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
- `css/style.css`: This file contains the styles for the webpage. It defines the layout, colors, and fonts of the elements on the webpage.
- `js/plasma.js`: This file exports two functions:
  - `generatePlasma(canvas, width, height, colors)`: This function generates a plasma effect using the HTML5 canvas element. It takes in parameters for the canvas element, the width and height of the canvas, and the color scheme for the plasma effect.
  - `animatePlasma(canvas, width, height, speed)`: This function animates the plasma effect by continuously redrawing it on the canvas. It takes in parameters for the canvas element, the width and height of the canvas, and the animation speed.
